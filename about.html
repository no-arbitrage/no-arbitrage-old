<h4>What is No Arbitrage</h4>
<p>
    :earth_asia:&nbsp;No arbitrage is a fundamental concpet to the Modern Portfolio Theories and pricing models 
    for the most complex financial products such as Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
    Some works from those academic giants has been recognised with Nobel Prizes. However, The basic idea is simple, 
No profit gain is possible without taking appropriate risks in an efficient market. Or simply No pain, no gain.  
  It is a practical philosophy of living. 
  <br> <br> No Arbitrate (this site) is my personal blog created to share practical financial knowledge, 
  ranging from basics to advanced concepts, and from theory to hands-on spreadsheet techniques. 
  It’s a space for exchanging ideas, making connections, and inspiring both readers and myself.

<h4>My Background</h4>
<p>
    I am Joseph Cai, a financial analyst living in London, originally from China. 
    With over a decade of formal academic training in finance, my expertise lies primarily in corporate finance. 
    However, my interests extend well beyond that field. I'm deeply fascinated by derivative products, largely due to their mathematical rigor and the sophisticated modeling they require.
</p>
<p>
    In recent years, I've also embarked on a journey to expand my technical skill set through programming. 
    I started with SQL and then moved on to DAX (Power BI), M-Scripting (Power Query), and Python. 
    Lately, I've been experimenting with automating tasks using TypeScript in Excel.

<h4>Life is about Learning</h4>
<p>
    I've taken many turns in my career, and one thing I've learned is that life's path is rarely a straight line. 
    A valued mentor and friend once encouraged me that if you are focused on your goal and learn from mistakes, you will reach there sooner or later.
    
    The most meaningful achievements often take time to materialize. It's crucial to be patient and stay committed to the process because, 
    in the words of James Clear from <em>Atomic Habits</em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>"The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision... It is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p> You have to trust that you can rise through and above adversity. </p>
